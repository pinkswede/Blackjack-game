# Rules and gameplay
There are simple rules in place in order for the game to be played:

- Both player and dealer start with 2 cards each

- Once the game has commenced, the player will be given the choice to either draw or stand

- If they choose draw, an additional card will be added into their set

- If they choose to stand, it will be the dealers turn

- For the dealer, if the total card count is above 17, the dealer will stand (stop drawing cards)

- The player is allowed to keep drawing cards at a limitless rate until they either choose to stand, or go bust

- If the player goes bust, the dealer will win (and vice versa)

- If the dealer and player both stand, the computer will declare either a win, draw or loss for the player

- If the players card value is below the dealers, and the dealer did not go above 21, the dealer wins, and the same is treu in the inverse scenario

- In the instance where both player and dealer have the same card value, a draw will be declared

- Once the game has ceased, the player will be prompted with the option to either play again, or stop
